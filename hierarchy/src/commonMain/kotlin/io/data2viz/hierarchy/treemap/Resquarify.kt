/**
 * Like treemapSquarify, except preserves the topology (node adjacencies) of the previous layout computed by
 * treemapResquarify, if there is one and it used the same target aspect ratio.
 * This tiling method is good for animating changes to treemaps because it only changes node sizes and
 * not their relative positions, thus avoiding distracting shuffling and occlusion.
 * The downside of a stable update, however, is a suboptimal layout for subsequent updates: only the first layout
 * uses the Bruls et al. squarified algorithm.
